    "说明：\n",
    "    连续排列N堆石头。第i堆有stone[i]石头。\n",
    "    一次移动包括将正好K个连续的桩合并为一个桩，并且此移动的成本等于这K个桩中的石头总数。\n",
    "    找到将所有石头堆合并为一堆的最低成本。\n",
    "    如果不可能，则返回-1。\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "    Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2\n",
    "    Output: 20\n",
    "    Explanation: \n",
    "        We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].\n",
    "        We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].\n",

    "    The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "    Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3\n",
    "    Output: -1\n",
    "    Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore. \n",
    "                 So the task is impossible.\n",
